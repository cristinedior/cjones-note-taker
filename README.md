# Module 10 Assignment: Object-oriented Programming Challenge: SVG Logo Maker

## Getting Started

This project involved creating a note-taker application. I started by bringing in the starter code provided for this challenge.

I started the whole process, with a very basic outline of what I wanted each file to store, making comments through out the page of how I wanted something to function or look.

**User Story**

- AS A small business owner
- I WANT to be able to write and save notes
- SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

**Acceptance Criteria**

- GIVEN a note-taking application
- WHEN I open the Note Taker
- THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
- WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
- THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
- WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
- THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page
- WHEN I click on the Save button
- THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear
- WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
- THEN that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation
- WHEN I click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page
- THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears
